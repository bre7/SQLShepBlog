### Overview

In this lab you will learn to navigate the Azure Machine Learning Workspace and created an experiment using Automated Machine Learning.  You will deploy an AML Workspace to a resource group, create compute, create an automated machine learning experiment and evaluate the results. Once complete you will deploy it to a container instance and prepare if for deployment.


### Learning Objectives
-	Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace
-   Create Compute 
-	Create Automated Machine Learning Experiment


Prerequisites
-  Familiarity with Microsoft Azure


Time Estimate
- 2 hours

Accessing and ending the Lab Environment

SkillMeUp Real Time Labs use a virtual machine for all lab exercises. This allows you access to all of the tools and software needed to complete the lab without requiring you to install anything on your local computer.

The virtual machine may take several minutes to fully provision due to software installation and supporting files to copy.

After you have completed all of the lab exercises ensure you click the End Lab button to get access to your certification of completion.

Accessing Microsoft Azure
Launch Chrome from the virtual machine desktop and navigate to the URL below. Your Azure Credentials are available by clicking the Cloud Icon at the top of the Lab Player.
